# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1:

Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation.

### Step 2:

Get the 2 points from the user.

### Step 3:

Substitute the values in the distance formula <br>

import math
x1, y1 = 4, 2
x2, y2 = 10, 6
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```  
### OUTPUT:
